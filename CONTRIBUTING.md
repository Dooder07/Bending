### Code Style

- Follow java naming conventions
- Use a mixture of FP (recommended where possible as it makes code more concise and readable) and classic OOP as appropriate
- If in doubt, try to emulate the surrounding code's style

## Project Layout

The project currently has a single module, but it may be split into sub-modules (API and Implementation) in the future.

`me.moros.bending` is the top level package.

### Sub-packages

- `ability` - Contains all ability implementations
- `command` - Contains all plugin commands, this project uses [ACF](https://github.com/aikar/commands)
- `game` - Contains all data and controllers for the main logic of the game
- `model` - Contains the model for the plugin's data and systems
- `protection` - Contains all world/region protection systems
- `storage` - Contains everything related to persistent storage (databases)
- `util` - Contains all utility classes

A more detailed diagram will be posted in the future to explain how systems interact with each other.
